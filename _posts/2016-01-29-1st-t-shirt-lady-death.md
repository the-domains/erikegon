# 1st T-Shirt: Lady Death

My first trial illustrating a T-shirt. On my side I had two markers and not much of a planing. I just wanted to go with the flow and make a beautiful image. 

I really liked the final result, although I would make some things differently. The main learning concerns the horizontal available area. After dressing my new t-shirt, I realized part of the drawing got hidden below my arms...

I'll do better next time. :)
